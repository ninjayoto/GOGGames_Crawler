# Howto
This is hacky, I would do it different today but hey it works.

Change the number in https://github.com/fionera/GOGGames_Crawler/blob/master/crawl.php#L12 to the number of the last page.

You need Composer https://getcomposer.org/

```
composer install
php crawl.php
php array_to_list.txt.php
```
